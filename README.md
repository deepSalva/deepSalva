## Hi there 👋 :sunny::surfer:

Welcome to my coding space!  

I'm a **Software Engineer** with a strong expertise in **cloud-native backend development and distributed systems**. I love designing and building robust systems that scale efficiently and follow best software engineering practices.  

### 🚧 What I do:
- **Backend Development** — primarily working with **Java**, and also fluent in **Python** for various tasks.  
- **Cloud & Distributed Systems** — passionate about building resilient, scalable services in cloud-native environments.  
- **Performance & Optimization** — always curious about how to make things faster, better, and more reliable.  
- **Automation & Scripting** — a fan of writing **Bash scripts** to simplify workflows.  

### 🧠 Currently learning:
- Diving into **Go** to expand my toolset for cloud-native and distributed systems engineering.  
- Experimenting with **nano microservice architecture** as a personal project — starting with a system to generate random numbers (because, why not?).  

### 🤝 Open to:
- **Collaborating on interesting backend, cloud, or open-source projects.**  
- Chatting about **Software Engineering best practices, distributed systems design, and performance tuning**.  

### ⚙️ Tech & Interests:
- **Languages**: Java, Python, Bash (and learning Go!)  
- **Interests**: Software Architecture, Cloud Native, Microservices, Distributed Systems, Performance Engineering.  
- **Hobbies**: Ancient Roman history buff, **Calisthenics** practitioner, and family time enthusiast.  

Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or chat about engineering, history, or workouts!
