## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ :sunny::surfer:

Welcome to my coding world!!

I am a Data Engineer focused on building scalable, high-performance infrastructure for delivering clear business insights.

I mostly code in **Python** and **Java** and I am into learning **Scala**. The frameworks and environments you can find in my space are: Apache Flink, Apache Spark, Apache Airflow, SQL, Redshift, Apache Cassandra, Apache Kafka and Apache Hadoop.
